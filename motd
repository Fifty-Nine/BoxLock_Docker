Welcome to the BoxLock firmware build environment!

The firmware build tree is available at /root/BoxLock_Firmware.
Dependencies are at /root/pkg.

To build the firmware:

  # cd /root/BoxLock_Firmware
  # make

To download the firmware to a connected device, first connect
to the device using OpenOCD, then [magic happens].
